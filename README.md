# Introduction
- Hello! My name is Iker and I'm 20 years old.
- I'm currently studing CS at UPM.
- I consider myself a blissful and grateful person.
- My main purpose with this great tool is that I want learn constantly.

# About my Skills...
- In these days, it is quite important to have different skills that will make a difference from others.
- Therefore, working on them will always be positive for yourself.

## Soft Skills
- Team Work: working with other might some times put you in trouble, but this can be solved with some extra energy and patience.
- Leadership: I've always encountered myself in situations where I had to be the leader, but this came naturally, so I can manage teams with almost no effort.
- Adaptability: moving into another technology or situation is something that almost never caused me any problem.
- Time Management: I can find a way to manage my time in a way that it will allow me to have time for any other projects

## Hard Skills
- Languages: for now, I speak 2 languages:
  - Spanish: native level.
  - English: B2 level certified by _Cambridge_, with intention to have C1 level.
- Developing: I have tried some different programming languages in some projects:
  - _C_: this language has stunned me from the begging, so I will be doing some projects on my own to have a good time!
  - _Java_: this language is the most common in my university, so I have worked with it several times
  - _Git_: obviously, any developing project must be done with this tool, which I have used in some projects to have a better working experience
- Others: these tools are useful as well:
  - _Obsidian_: this tool allows you to manipulate _Markdown_ files easily, and therefore, to organize any kind of documentation
  - _Excalidraw_: I find that drawing can be neccessary some times, but I think what this tool has to offer is way more useful than other tools that I have tried
  - _Latex_: this tool gives you the chance to create documents and essays with a very formal look, which gives you the chance to look better than others
 
# Currently...
- As I said before, I'm studiyng. However, I'm trying to find some scholarship opportunities. Consequently, I will have some work experience and it will definitely boost my opoortunites in the future
- However, I will try to do some projects here on my own, obviously, shared for everyone
